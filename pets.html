            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <p>
                Biscuit is a 2 year old shiba inu dog. Shiba inus are energetic and playful dogs. Biscuit enjoys running outside in
                circles and then laying down in the grass in the sun for hours. He also likes going for occasional swims.
            </p>
            <p>
                As energetic as Biscuit is, he also likes to relax. He loves to sleep in his dog bed and watch Netflix with his owners.
                His favorite treat is apples.

            <img src="images/hachi_onlawn.jpg" alt="Akita named Hachi sitting on the front lawn" width=400>
            <p>Hachi is a 13 year old Akita. He’s a very old boy who likes to play in snow and run laps around our yard. He is super nice and never bites. He is timid but friendly and will always come and greet visitors with a smile and a few barks.

        </p>
            <p>Hachi is a jealous dog. Although shy, he does not like it when other dogs steal attention from him and he will lightly bite them. When Hachi shared the house with another dog, a small poodle, he would constantly bicker with the poodle when it was being loud.

            <p>
                Guinea pigs are a naturally energetic animal, who spend up to 20 hours a day awake. Despite being awake for long periods
                of time, they naturally hide in their habitats, and can be difficult to see in their inclosures. Guinea pigs naturally
                are social creatures that enjoy socializing with other guinea pigs, in the wild they form packs of five to ten.
            </p>
            <p>
                Leo is a half-lazy, half-lively guinea pig that either likes to run around on the floor, doing tiny hops, or likes to
                lay down in the cage for hours at a time nibbling at hay. His favorite hobby is eating, and he can tell whenever someone
                is about to give good to him by waiting at the end of the cardboard box patio he has attached to his cage.
            </p>

            <h2>Cooky</h2>
            <img src="images/cookysmiley.jpg" alt="White and gray Bernedoodle sitting on a couch and smiling." width=400>
            <p>Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go on walks, eat snacks and treats (not his own dog food), get pets and belly rubs, and cuddle. You can usually find him playing with his toys in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or cooling off in the garage.
        </p>
            <p>He’s still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings the doorbell, Cooky gets really excited, barking and dashing towards the front door. He also jumps really high when he’s hyper and wags his tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just as much as he likes to play.</p>
